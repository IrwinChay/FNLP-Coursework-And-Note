Assumption: corpus used contains all words and all form of English, development set drawn from same source as training set 

Model problem: only cross entropy could be measured instead of actual entropy, and different models shows different performance. 
Assumption: the model used could compress the data with highest efficiency and its cross entropy = entropy 

Since per word cross entropy could be approximated by the average negative log probability a model assigns to each word, a Ngram model (with smoothing such as back off) is trained by MLE to estimate probability of next word. The model is then tested on another development set. As N increases, the cross entropy approaches the entropy of English.""")[:1000]
